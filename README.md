I am a software developer currently learning through the X-Academy bootcamp, constantly uploading projects and soon to be an engineering student in college.  What appeals to me is Create, I know that this word covers a lot, as it is very generic but it really is what we do, we create solutions, new tools, we are always in constant innovation, so if what we are passionate about is to create.

### Currently, I'm self-studying, focusing on creating custom projects and applications 🖤.
Focused on and learning JavaScript in depth.
Thinking and creating new ways to get things done. 
I like to get out of my comfort zone and experiment.




And finally I want to share my projects and growth with people who are interested 🐰.
